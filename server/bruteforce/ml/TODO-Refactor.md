## detector.go <a name="detectorgp"></a>

### Issues and Recommendations

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Replace simple error returns with more descriptive errors using `fmt.Errorf` to provide context.
   - Consider using custom error types for specific error conditions.

2. **Code Organization**:
   - The `Predict` method is quite long (360+ lines). Consider breaking it down into smaller, focused functions.
   - Extract the feature processing logic into separate helper methods.

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Instead of accessing global state directly (e.g., `globalTrainer`), consider passing dependencies explicitly.
   - This would make testing easier and reduce coupling.

4. **Concurrency Safety**:
   - The code uses global mutexes (`globalTrainerMutex`, `modelTrainedMutex`). Consider encapsulating this state within a service struct.
   - Use context cancellation for graceful shutdown of goroutines.

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Replace direct access to configuration (`config.GetFile().GetBruteForce()...`) with dependency injection.
   - This would make the code more testable and less coupled to the global configuration.

6. **Logging Consistency**:
   - Standardize logging patterns. Some logs use `level.Info(log.Logger).Log()` while others use `util.DebugModule()`.
   - Consider creating helper functions for common logging patterns.

7. **Feature Encoding**:
   - The string feature encoding logic (lines 114-226) is complex and has multiple nested conditions. Extract this into a dedicated method.
   - Consider using a strategy pattern for different encoding types.

8. **Redis Interactions**:
   - Extract Redis operations into a dedicated service or repository layer.
   - This would make it easier to mock Redis for testing and centralize Redis-related code.

9. **Constants and Magic Numbers**:
   - Replace magic numbers (e.g., `0.5`, `1000`) with named constants.
   - Group related constants together.

10. **Documentation**:
    - Add more detailed documentation for complex methods.
    - Document the purpose and behavior of each struct field.

11. **Error Metrics**:
    - Add metrics for error conditions to help with monitoring and debugging.
