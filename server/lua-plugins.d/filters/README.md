# Filter Plugins for Nauthilus

This directory contains Lua filter plugins for the Nauthilus authentication system. Filter plugins are executed during the authentication process to analyze, validate, or modify authentication requests before they are processed.

## Available Plugins

### account_centric_monitoring.lua
Monitors authentication attempts at the account level to detect potential distributed brute force attacks and suspicious access patterns.

**Features:**
- Tracks IPs that attempt to access specific accounts
- Records failed authentication attempts per account
- Calculates metrics like unique IPs per account and IP-to-failure ratios
- Detects distributed brute force attacks where many IPs target a single account
- Adds suspicious accounts to a monitoring list for enhanced protection

**Usage:**
The plugin runs automatically on each authentication attempt. It uses the following thresholds by default:
- `threshold_unique_ips`: 10 (alerts if more than 10 unique IPs try to access an account)
- `threshold_ip_to_fail_ratio`: 0.8 (alerts if the ratio of unique IPs to failed attempts is high)

You can optionally configure a custom Redis pool using the `CUSTOM_REDIS_POOL_NAME` environment variable.

### geoip.lua
Analyzes the geographic origin of authentication requests using IP geolocation to detect suspicious login attempts from unusual locations.

**Features:**
- Determines the country and region of origin for authentication requests
- Maintains a history of locations per user for anomaly detection
- Identifies authentication attempts from high-risk regions
- Supports whitelisting and blacklisting of countries and regions
- Provides detailed logging of geographic access patterns

**Usage:**
Configure the plugin through environment variables or Nauthilus configuration:
- `GEOIP_POLICY_URL`: URL endpoint for the geoip_policyd service

The plugin connects to the geoip_policyd service to evaluate geographic access policies and determine if authentication should be allowed based on the client's location.

### monitoring.lua
Provides comprehensive monitoring of authentication activities, system performance, and security metrics.

**Features:**
- Tracks authentication success and failure rates
- Monitors system performance metrics during authentication
- Detects anomalies in authentication patterns
- Provides real-time visibility into system health
- Supports integration with monitoring systems via metrics export

**Usage:**
The plugin runs automatically on each authentication attempt. You can configure monitoring thresholds and sensitivity through the Nauthilus configuration file:
- `monitoring_sensitivity`: Adjusts the sensitivity of anomaly detection (low, medium, high)
- `monitoring_metrics_retention`: How long to retain detailed metrics (in days)

The plugin stores metrics in Redis for later analysis and visualization.
