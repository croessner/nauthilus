# Changes to GetOrCreateOneHotEncoding Method

## Overview
The `GetOrCreateOneHotEncoding` method in `ml_detector.go` has been updated to ensure consistency across multiple instances by integrating with Redis. The method now follows a "load first, then compare, then save if needed" approach with distributed locking.

## Changes Made
1. Modified the `GetOrCreateOneHotEncoding` method to:
   - First check the local cache for existing encodings
   - Acquire a distributed lock using `AcquireTrainingLock`
   - Load current one-hot encodings from Redis
   - Update local cache with Redis data if available
   - Create new encodings only if they don't exist in Redis
   - Save updated encodings back to Redis
   - Release the lock

2. Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging for Redis operations

3. Used a dedicated Redis key (`getMLRedisKeyPrefix() + "model_encodings"`) for storing one-hot encodings

## Benefits
- Ensures consistency of one-hot encodings across multiple instances
- Prevents race conditions with distributed locking
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Technical Details
- The method uses the existing `AcquireTrainingLock` and `ReleaseTrainingLock` functions for distributed locking
- One-hot encodings are stored in Redis with a 30-day TTL
- The implementation gracefully handles Redis connection failures by falling back to local operation
- Debug logging is provided at key points in the process

## Testing
The implementation has been manually tested to ensure it correctly:
- Loads existing encodings from Redis
- Creates new encodings when needed
- Saves updated encodings back to Redis
- Handles error conditions gracefully
